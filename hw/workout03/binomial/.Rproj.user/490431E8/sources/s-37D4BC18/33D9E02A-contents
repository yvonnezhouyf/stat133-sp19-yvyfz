## bin_choose()
This function calculates the number of ways to choose a number of objects in a total number of objects, which is just like the already defined choose() funciton in r.

```{r}
bin_choose(5, 3)
bin_choose(10, 2)
bin_choose(15, 0)
```

## bin_variable()
This function returns a binvar object that contains the number of trials and the probability of success with the validity of trials and probability been checked.

```{r}
bin_variable(3, 0.5)
bin_variable(1, 0.4)
bin_variable(0, 0.5)
```

## bin_probability()
This function calculate the probability of success in a number of trials with a certain probability of success that is passed into the function.

```{r}
bin_probability(3, 5, 0.5)
bin_probability(1, 10, 0.4)
bin_probability(0, 15, 0.5)
```

## bin_distribution()
This function returns a data frame that contains the number of trial, the probability of success with a certain probability that is passed in.

```{r}
bin_distribution(5, 0.3)
bin_distribution(10, 0.5)
```

## bin_cumulative()
This function returns a data frame that contains the number of trial, the probability of success with a certain probability that is passed in, and the cumulative probability of success. (The data frame this function will return will have an extra column containing the cumulative probability of success comparing to the data frame returned by bin_distribution().)

```{r}
bin_cumulative(5, 0.3)
bin_cumulative(10, 0.5)
```

## bin_mean()
This function calculates the mean with the provided number of trials and the probability of success.

```{r}
bin_mean(5, 0.3)
bin_mean(10, 0.5)
```

## bin_variance()
This function calculates the variance with the provided number of trials and the probability of success.

```{r}
bin_variance(5, 0.3)
bin_variance(10, 0.5)
```

## bin_mode()
This function calculates the mode with the provided number of trials and the probability of success.

```{r}
bin_mode(5, 0.3)
bin_mode(10, 0.5)
```

## bin_skewness()
This function calculates the skewness with the provided number of trials and the probability of success.

```{r}
bin_skewness(5, 0.3)
bin_skewness(10, 0.5)
```

## bin_kurtosis()
This function calculates the kurtosis with the provided number of trials and the probability of success.

```{r}
bin_kurtosis(5, 0.3)
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.5)
```
