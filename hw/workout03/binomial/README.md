## Overview

`"binomial"` is a minimal [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package that
provides functions to simulate the binomial distribution.

  - `bin_choose()` calculates the number of possibilities to select a number of objects from a total number of objects.
  - `bin_distribution()` creates a data frame that contains the trial number, the possibility to that trial.
  - `bin_cumulative()` creates a data frame that contains the trial number, the possibility to that trial and the cumulative possibility.
  - `bin_probability()` calculates the probability of getting a number of successes in a number of trials with a fixed probability of success that is passed in.
  - `bin_variable()` creates a binvar object.

## Motivation

This package has been developed to finish the workout03 of STAT 133 Spring 2019.
