### Discussion

From the data and analysis above, Kevin Durant is not the player who has the highest 2 point goal percentage and 3 point goal percentage, but his field goal percentage is the highest among the five players, showing that he is the kind of player who is stable at both the 2 point and 3 point goals comparing to the other four players. Andre Iguodala's two goal percentage, which is the highest among the five, showing that he is really a valuable player as it is quite outstanding for players to get a 63.8% of goal percentage. This is also true for Thompson. Three points goals, especially in the fiercing competitive field, is really hard to get. In this kind of situation, he can still reaches 42.4% of goals, which could be said as something magnificent. And Stephen Curry, as the player who made the largest amount of shoots and also the player who goals the largest amount, perfectly shows his skills and techniques in his every trial of goal.

### Conclusions

From the data and following analysis, it is not hard to see that Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are really four outstanding players in NBA. Graymond Green, since not in the list, is not that strong as the other four players. But, the data is only about the percentage of goaling of these five players, and goal percentages are only a part of the process of getting the players' value. So, we can see that Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are all good at goaling and they are all trying hard and showing their skills in the 2016 season, and they have all helped the Golden State Warriors to be the today's Golden State Warriors.
